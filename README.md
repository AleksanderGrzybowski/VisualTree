This project is a tree visualization tool, written as a base of my engineering thesis.

* only frontend technologies
* lots of data structure manipulation, which JS isn't suited best for :(
* some :) hacks here and there to keep it working
* few dead-end branches like trying to implement Red-Black tree deletion (don't do this) or migrate to TypeScript (too much reliance on duck typing everywhere)
* Jasmine tests, cause TDD is fun when it comes to algorithms :)
